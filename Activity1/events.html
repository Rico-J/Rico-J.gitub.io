            <h2>High School Graduation 2010</h2>
            It took me 6 years to graduate High School because I had decided to drop out and be around the wrong
            people.<br /> When I found out my girlfriend at the
            time was pregnant, I decided to go back to night school and graduate in one semester. </p>

            <h2>Basic Training</h2>
            I enlisted in the United States Army in 2011 at the age of 21.<br /> I wanted to provide a better future for
            my little family that I made.
            I graduated from basic training in Aug. 2011. <br />I went to AIT (Advanced Individual Training) for 10
            weeks after.<br /> Once training was completed, my first duty station was
            in South Korea for 1 year.</p>

            <h2>Married 2022</h2>During covid-19, my unit was activated by the Governor of Arizona to help with the
            crises. <br>I lead a 10 man team to cover down for St Vincent De Paul as they were no longer allowed to
            receive volunteers to help with food banks due to lock down restrictions.<br> This is where I met my wife.
            She was the volunteer coordinator, although we never spoke more than 20 words to each other for almost 6
            months.<br>
            After we found out that we shared the same love for music and horror movies, we quickly became close.<br> We
            married on October 31st 2022 By Wednesday Adams!</p>

            <h2>Going back to school</h2>Going back to school I knew would be a challenge for me but I just knew that I
            wanted to go but I didn't know what I wanted to study.<br> My first major that I had chose was B.S. in
            Justice Studies.
            I changed my major a few times until I found my passion for software development.</p>
