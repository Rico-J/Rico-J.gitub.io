        <p><strong>Welcome to my page! I little brief history of myself, I served 3 years active duty in the United States Army from 2011-2014. I spent my first year
            stationed in South Korea. I loved every moment of it and plan to visit again one day. After my active duty term, I enlisted in the Arizona Army National guard.
            I planned on going back to school during this time but never made the attempt as I had no idea what I wanted to do. I have always wanted to make music and share it with 
            the world but never made that leap. I have 3 children of my own and 2 bonus kids. I was married on October 31st 2022. I met my wife during Covid. I was in charge of a team 
            that would take on the volunteer services at St Vincent De Paul food bank. She was the volunteer coordinator. It would take us almost 6 months to carry on a conversation that lasted
            longer than 3 minutes. We discovered that we had a common ground, music. We both love the same music and going to live shows. Through out the page you will find my life in a 
            snap shot. Thanks for visiting!
